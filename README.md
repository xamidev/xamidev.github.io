# xamidev's personal webpage

This is my personal webpage.
I made this project to experiment HTML/CSS/JS a bit and to introduce myself.
Feel free to report any bugs, or to suggest any ideas.

### What I would like to implement

- More tutorials for people that want to do small projects
- Better visual effects, and overall style
- A better homepage, this one is a bit raw

### What I learned (for now)

- Accordion (js)
- Animated color bar (css)
- Wrappers in html
